                    <p>
                        Ratan Tata was born to one of India's most prosperous industrialist families in Mumbai in 1937.
                        His grandfather Jamsedji
                        Tata was the founder of Tata Group, who pioneered industrialisation in India after independence.
                        Tata went to Cornell
                        University in the US to study architecture and structural engineering and later pursued a
                        management course from Harvard
                        University.

                        Despite being the future chairman of Tata Group, he started his career at the root level working
                        alongside blue-collar
                        employees in Tata Steel Division. In 1971, Tata was appointed the Director-in-Charge of the
                        National Radio and
                        Electronics Company Limited (NELCO), which was in a dire need for a revival and turned it
                        around.

                    <h3 class="heading">Ratan Tata as Chairperson of Tata Sons</h3>

                    <p>
                        When JRD Tata stepped down as the chairperson of Tata Sons in 1991, he named Ratan Tata his
                        successor. He faced stiff
                        resistance from many companies heads who spent decades in their respective companies. Tata began
                        replacing them by
                        setting a retirement age. He further made it compulsory for each company to report to the group
                        office. Under his
                        leadership, the overlapping companies of Tata Sons were streamlined into a synergized whole.

                        During his 21 years of stewardship, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit over 50 times. He
                        got Tata Tea to acquire
                        Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and Tata Steel to acquire Corus, turning the
                        organization from a
                        largely India-centric group into a global business.

                        He also conceptualized the Tata Nano car. The car was capped at a price that was within the
                        reach of the average Indian
                        consumer.

                        Upon turning 75, Ratan Tata stepped down as the Chairperson of Tata Sons on 28 December 2012.
                        Cyrus Mistry was named his
                        successor, however, the Board of Directors and Legal division voted for his removal on 24
                        October 2016 and Ratan Tata
                        was then made the group's interim chairman.

                        A selection committee comprising Ratan Tata, TVS Group head Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra of
                        Bain Capital, former
                        diplomat Ronen Sen, and Lord Kumar Bhattacharya was formed to find the successor of Ratan Tata.
                        The committee named
                        Natarajan Chandrasekaran as the Chairperson of Tata Sons on 12 January 2017.

                        Ratan Tata invested his personal savings in Snapdeal, Teabox, and CashKaro.com. He also invested
                        in Ola Cabs, Xiaomi,
                        Nestaway, and Dogspot.

                    <p>
                        Being a supporter of education, medicine, and rural development, Ratan Tata supported the
                        University of New South Wales
                        Faculty of Engineering to provide improved water for challenged areas.

                        Tata Education and Development Trust endowed a $28 million Tata Scholarship Fund that will allow
                        Cornell University to
                        provide financial aid to undergraduate students from India. The annual scholarship will support
                        approximately 20
                        students at a given time.

                        Tata Group companies and Tata charities donated $50 million in 2010 to Harvard Business School
                        (HBS) for the
                        construction of an executive center.

                        Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) donated $35 million to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) for a
                        facility to research
                        cognitive systems and autonomous vehicles. It is the largest ever donation by a company and the
                        48,000 square-foot
                        building is called TCS Hall.

                        Tata Group donated Rs. 950 million to the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 2014 and
                        formed Tata Center for
                        Technology and Design (TCTD). It was the largest ever donation received in the history of the
                        institute.

                        Tata Trusts also provided a grant of ₹750 million to the Centre for Neuroscience, the Indian
                        Institute of Science, to
                        study mechanisms underlying the cause of Alzheimer's disease and to evolve methods for its early
                        diagnosis and
                        treatment.

                        Tata Group also formed the MIT Tata Center of Technology and Design at Massachusetts Institute
                        of Technology (MIT) to
                        address the challenges of resource-constrained communities, with an initial focus on India.

                    <h3 class="heading"> How did Ratan Tata deal with challenges?</h3>

                    <p>
                        A big challenge Ratan Tata faced was when he met the Ford leadership to sell the Tata Group's
                        car business. The deal
                        didn't come through but Tata worked towards boosting the auto business. In 2008, nine years
                        later, when Ford was on the
                        brink of bankruptcy, it was Tata who managed to seal the company's Jaguar Land Rover acquisition
                        for over $2 billion.
                        Further testimony to his power to overcome challenges came during the 26/11 terror attacks when
                        he led the efforts to
                        help victims outside the Taj hotel. To quote his own words, “If you want to walk fast, walk
                        alone. If you want to walk
                        far, walk together.”
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="heading"> A True Leader in All Its Sense</h3>

                    <p>
                        Tata is a true embodiment of leadership, who always believed in putting a humane face before
                        commercial gains. He is
                        involved in numerous philanthropic activities providing quality life, education in rural India.

                        He has received great recognition in his lifetime. In 2000, the government of India decorated
                        him with Padma Bhushan,
                        and in 2008, he received Padma Vibhushan. Apart from that, he was awarded several international
                        accolades including
                        Honorary Doctorates from Ohio State University, University of Warwick, and Asian Institute of
                        Technology, Bangkok.

                        His fortune stands at a staggering volume of GBP 300 million, but he owns less than 1 percent in
                        the colossal
                        conglomerate of Tata Groups. Majority of Tata Group shares are owned by several charitable
                        trusts that finance several
                        philanthropic activities.

                        A remarkable human being and industrialist, amazingly Ratan Tata never featured in Forbes
                        billionaires list.
